              <p>
                Each UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry contains all curated protein products encoded by a given gene in a given species or strain. For each UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry, we choose a canonical (or representative) sequence for display that should conform to at least one of the following criteria:
              </p>

                <li>
                  It is widely expressed;

                <li>
                  It is encoded by conserved exons found in orthologous sequences;

                  It is identical to consensus sequences chosen by other resources and genome curation efforts such as CCDS and MANE (see also

              <h2

                Are all isoforms described in one UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry?
              </h2>
              

              <p>
                Whenever possible, all the protein products encoded by one gene in a given species are described in a single UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry, including isoforms generated by alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative translation initiation (*). However, some alternative splicing isoforms derived from the same gene share only a few exons, if any at all, the same for some 'trans-splicing' events. In these cases, the divergence is obviously too important to merge all protein sequences into a single entry and the isoforms have to be described in separate 'external' entries.
              </p>
              

              <p>
                Example: 
                <a
                  href="/uniprotkb/P42284#sequences"
                >
                  isoforms derived from the lola gene (Drosophila melanogaster)
                </a>
              </p>
              

              <p>
                (*) Important remark: Due to the increase of sequence data coming from large-scale sequencing projects, UniProtKB/TrEMBL may contain additional predicted sequences encoded by genes which are described in a UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry.
              </p>
