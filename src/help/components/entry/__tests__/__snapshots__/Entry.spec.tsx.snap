              <p>
                To reduce redundancy, the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot policy is to describe all the protein products encoded by one gene in a given species in a single entry. We choose for each entry a canonical sequence based on at least one of the following criteria:
              </p>
              

              <ol>
                

                <li>
                  It is the most prevalent.
                </li>
                

                <li>
                  It is the most similar to orthologous sequences found in other species.
                </li>
                

                <li>
                  By virtue of its length or amino acid composition, it allows the clearest description of domains, isoforms, polymorphisms, post-translational modifications, etc.
                </li>
                

                <li>
                  In the absence of any information, we choose the longest sequence.
                </li>
                

              </ol>
              

              <p>
                Note that for organisms for which the genome sequence is completed, we choose the protein sequence derived from genome translation, unless it is clearly established that a different polymorphism is more frequent for a given position.
              </p>
              

              <p>
                Differences to other sequences are documented in the 'Sequence' section (in the flat file FT keys: VAR_SEQ, CONFLICT, VARIANT, ...). Additional information can be found in the 'Alternative sequence' subsection.
              </p>
              

              <p>
                The various UniProtKB distribution formats (Flat Text, XML, RDF/XML) display only the canonical sequence. The website's 'Sequences' section displays the canonical sequence, but for convenience it offers also a view of the isoforms that are described in the 'Alternative sequence' subsection.
              </p>
              

              <p>
                <strong>
                  Are all isoforms described in one UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry?
                </strong>
              </p>
              

              <p>
                Whenever possible, all the protein products encoded by one gene in a given species are described in a single UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry, including isoforms generated by alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative translation initiation (*). However, some alternative splicing isoforms derived from the same gene share only a few exons, if any at all, the same for some 'trans-splicing' events. In these cases, the divergence is obviously too important to merge all protein sequences into a single entry and the isoforms have to be described in separate 'external' entries.
              </p>
              

              <p>

                  isoforms derived from the lola gene (Drosophila melanogaster)
                </a>
              </p>
              

              <p>
                (*) Important remark: Due to the increase of sequence data coming from large-scale sequencing projects, UniProtKB/TrEMBL may contain additional predicted sequences encoded by genes which are described in a UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry.
