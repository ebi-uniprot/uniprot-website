In bacteria with 1 membrane (Gram-positive) the cell envelope consists of the cytoplasmic membrane, cell wall and capsule. In bacteria with 2 membranes (Gram-negative) the envelope consists of the cytoplasmic membrane, cell wall, periplasmic space, outer membrane and capsule. The archaeal cell envelope generally consists of single membrane covered by a surface layer (S-layer). Ignicoccus species exceptionally have an outer membrane which encloses a large periplasmic space. Extreme thermophiles and acidophiles have tetraether type glycerophospholipids with C40 isoprenoid chains. The yeast cell envelope is a protecting capsule which consists of the cytoplasmic membrane, the periplasmic space, and the cell wall.',
